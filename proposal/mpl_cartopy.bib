abstract={Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract Two sprite-producing thunderstorms were observed on 8 and 25 June 2012 in northeastern Colorado by a combination of low-light cameras, a lightning mapping array, polarimetric and Doppler radars, the National Lightning Detection Network, and charge moment change measurements. The 8 June event evolved from a tornadic hailstorm to a larger multicellular system that produced 21 observed positive sprites in 2 h. The majority of sprites occurred during a lull in convective strength, as measured by total flash rate, flash energy, and radar echo volume. Mean flash area spiked multiple times during this period; however, total flash rates still exceeded 60 min−1, and portions of the storm featured a complex anomalous charge structure, with midlevel positive charge near −20°C. The storm produced predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning. All sprite-parent flashes occurred on the northeastern flank of the storm, where strong westerly upper level flow was consistent with advection of charged precipitation away from convection, providing a pathway for stratiform lightning. The 25 June event was another multicellular hailstorm with an anomalous charge structure that produced 26 positive sprites in less than 1 h. The sprites again occurred during a convective lull, with relatively weaker reflectivity and lower total flash rate but relatively larger mean flash area. However, all sprite parents occurred in or near convection and tapped charge layers in adjacent anvil cloud. The results demonstrate the sprite production by convective ground strokes in anomalously charged storms and also indicate that sprite production and convective vigor are inversely related in mature storms.},

abstract = {Abstract The seasonal and diurnal cycles of ocean vector winds in the domain of the South China Sea are characterized and compared using RapidScat and the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) data sets. Broad agreement in seasonal flow patterns exists between these data sets during the year 2015. Both observe the dramatic reversal from wintertime trade winds (November–April) to westerly flow associated with the summer monsoon (May–October). These seasonal changes have strong but not equivalent effects on mean wind divergence patterns in both data sets. Specifically near the Philippines, the data sets agree on several aspects of the seasonal mean and diurnal cycle of near-surface vector winds and divergence. In particular, RapidScat and CCMP agree that daytime onshore and nocturnal offshore flow patterns affect the diurnal cycle of winds up to ~200 km west of Luzon, Philippines. Observed disagreements over the diurnal cycle are explainable by measurement uncertainty, as well as shortcomings in both data sets.},

title={Highly structured slow solar wind emerging from an equatorial coronal hole},
journal={Nature},
year={2019},
month={Dec},
day={01},
volume={576},
number={7786},
pages={237-242},
abstract={During the solar minimum, when the Sun is at its least active, the solar wind1,2 is observed at high latitudes as a predominantly fast (more than 500 kilometres per second), highly Alfv{\'e}nic rarefied stream of plasma originating from deep within coronal holes. Closer to the ecliptic plane, the solar wind is interspersed with a more variable slow wind3 of less than 500 kilometres per second. The precise origins of the slow wind streams are less certain4; theories and observations suggest that they may originate at the tips of helmet streamers5,6, from interchange reconnection near coronal hole boundaries7,8, or within coronal holes with highly diverging magnetic fields9,10. The heating mechanism required to drive the solar wind is also unresolved, although candidate mechanisms include Alfv{\'e}n-wave turbulence11,12, heating by reconnection in nanoflares13, ion cyclotron wave heating14 and acceleration by thermal gradients1. At a distance of one astronomical unit, the wind is mixed and evolved, and therefore much of the diagnostic structure of these sources and processes has been lost. Here we present observations from the Parker Solar Probe15 at 36 to 54 solar radii that show evidence of slow Alfv{\'e}nic solar wind emerging from a small equatorial coronal hole. The measured magnetic field exhibits patches of large, intermittent reversals that are associated with jets of plasma and enhanced Poynting flux and that are interspersed in a smoother and less turbulent flow with a near-radial magnetic field. Furthermore, plasma-wave measurements suggest the existence of electron and ion velocity-space micro-instabilities10,16 that are associated with plasma heating and thermalization processes. Our measurements suggest that there is an impulsive mechanism associated with solar-wind energization and that micro-instabilities play a part in heating, and we provide evidence that low-latitude coronal holes are a key source of the slow solar wind.},

This study describes an open-source method for reconstruction of imagery from those point detections that retains the quantitative physical measurements made by GLM, restores the spatial footprint of the events, and connects that spatial footprint to the groups and flashes. Meteorological signals are demonstrated to be more apparent in the gridded imagery than in the point detections, leading to their adoption by the United States National Weather Service as the first GLM product available in their real-time displays. Analysis of a mesoscale convective system over Argentina confirms that there is a class of propagating lightning observed by GLM (distinct from that in storm cores) that can be visualized and quantified using our imagery-based approach.},

Previous work has found that these layers are resolvable at the meter scale and that they are quasiperiodic in expression. However, the interrelationships of these deposits, along with their formative depositional process, has not yet been determined. Proposed formation mechanisms include fluviolacustrine deposition, groundwater upwelling and evaporation, and aeolian or distal volcanic air fall. For this study, we measured layer thicknesses from stereo image-derived topography within nine craters. We find two regionally extensive layered units with characteristic average bed thicknesses of 12 and 3.5 m and a possible third unit of intermediate thickness. Each unit was identified in a number of craters forming regionally consistent groups. These proposed units represent the first regional correlations of isolated sedimentary deposits in Arabia Terra and point to blanketing regional deposition over at least two separate geologic periods.},

The left Mastcam (M-34) has a 34 mm focal length, an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of 0.22 mrad, and a FOV of 20° × 15° over the full 1648 × 1200 pixel span of its Kodak KAI-2020 CCD. The right Mastcam (M-100) has a 100 mm focal length, an IFOV of 0.074 mrad, and a FOV of 6.8° × 5.1° using the same detector. The cameras are separated by 24.2 cm on the mast, allowing stereo images to be obtained at the resolution of the M-34 camera. Each camera has an eight-position filter wheel, enabling it to take Bayer pattern red, green, and blue (RGB) “true color” images, multispectral images in nine additional bands spanning ~400–1100 nm, and images of the Sun in two colors through neutral density-coated filters. An associated Digital Electronics Assembly provides command and data interfaces to the rover, 8 Gb of image storage per camera, 11 bit to 8 bit companding, JPEG compression, and acquisition of high-definition video. Here we describe the preflight and in-flight calibration of Mastcam images, the ways that they are being archived in the NASA Planetary Data System, and the ways that calibration refinements are being developed as the investigation progresses on Mars. We also provide some examples of data sets and analyses that help to validate the accuracy and precision of the calibration.},

	abstract = {We report on a Kepler spacecraft survey during the K2 mission to characterize the rotational properties of 56 Trojan asteroids in the L4 cloud. More than one rotational period was observed for 51 of these targets, allowing for well constrained lightcurve rotation periods and amplitudes, five of which are found to be in conflict with previously published values. We find ∼10% of objects have rotational periods longer than 100 hr, an excess of slow rotators 10 times larger than suggested from the literature. Investigation of the rotational frequencies of our Kepler sample when combined with high-quality lightcurves in the literature reveals the distribution of rotational frequencies is non-Maxwellian even when consideration is given to size-dependent variations in rotational rate. From investigation of lightcurve shapes and amplitudes, we estimate the binary fraction within the Trojan population to be ∼6%–36% depending on the methodology utilized to identify binary candidates.}

	abstract = {NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft will conduct a close flyby of the cold-classical Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) designated (486958) 2014 MU69 on 2019 January 1. At a heliocentric distance of 44 au, “MU69” will be the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft. To enable this flyby, we have developed an extremely high-precision orbit fitting and uncertainty processing pipeline, making maximal use of the Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and pre-release versions of the ESA Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) catalog. This pipeline also enabled successful predictions of a stellar occultation by MU69 in 2017 July. We describe how we process the WFC3 images to match the Gaia DR2 catalog, extract positional uncertainties for this extremely faint target (typically 140 photons per WFC3 exposure), and translate those uncertainties into probability distribution functions for MU69 at any given time. We also describe how we use these uncertainties to guide New Horizons, plan stellar occultions of MU69, and derive MU69's orbital evolution and long-term stability.}
