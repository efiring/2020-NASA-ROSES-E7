\subsection{Matplotlib's role in scientific computing}

Matplotlib~\cite{Hunter:2007} provides the visualization for missions
and projects across all SMD divisions, including flagship
missions like the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the James Webb Space
Telescope~\cite{jwst_pipeline} (JWST), and the Curiosity Rover
Mastcam~\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/2016EA000219}.  Matplotlib is
part of the Scientific Python Ecosystem (SPE), a loosely defined
community of projects and programmers with the common goal of
advancing science through the use of the Python programming language.
This development is largely volunteer work or work that is sponsored
implicitly by specific science projects.  SPE, shown with a rough
schematic in Figure \ref{fig:ecosystem}, has a core of general purpose
domain-agnostic tools, like NumPy~\cite{Harris2020} and
SciPy~\cite{Virtanen2020}. Matplotlib is in the next ring of
specialized, but still domain agnostic tools, and is the most
prevalent data visualization library for the SPE.  The outer rings are
increasingly domain-specific tools, like
AstroPy~\cite{robitaille2013astropy} which is used for astrophysics,
SunPy~\cite{sunpy_community2020} which is used for heliophysics, and
MetPy which is used for Earth Science, all of which use Matplotlib for
specialized plotting.  This layered approach gives scientists and
engineers convenient and powerful high-level tools while enabling
direct access to the underlying libraries when needed.

    heliophysics divisions respectively, rely on Matplotlib.

  \label{fig:ecosystem}
\end{wrapfigure}



Matplotlib~\cite{Hunter:2007} is an established open source plotting
library with a BSD-compatible license that is currently used
throughout both the SMD science community and the wider scientific
community.  The initial work on Matplotlib was done in 2002 and the
first commits in the Matplotlib history date to early 2003.  Over the
last 17 years Matplotlib has been actively developed and maintained by
a vibrant, primarily volunteer, community.  Matplotlib has over 1,250
individual contributors to the code base, with many more individuals
having contributed in ways not easily track, such as answering user
questions on the mailing list or reporting issues.

Matplotlib has a high-level API for quick plotting, such as in
exploratory data analysis, plus a low-level API that gives full control for
fine-tuned publication-quality plots, for animations, for writing both
GUI-independent and GUI-specific tools for interactive data plotting, and
for output to a variety of vector and raster
formats including \texttt{svg}, \texttt{eps},
\texttt{pdf}, and \texttt{png}

Matplotlib's generality and flexibility means that it is readily extendable to
many data visualization domains.  A rich ecosystem of downstream packages use
Matplotlib as their base, providing domain-specific streamlining of
Matplotlib's API: including yt, astropy, ArviZ, seaborn, xarray, astropy, and
fast\_histogram.

Matplotlib is ubiquitous in scientific computing.  Conservative estimates based on downloads and web traffic on the documentation, indicate that Matplotlib has over a
million users.  We expect that a large fraction of NASA SMD-sponsored
projects rely on this shared infrastructure to some degree, but this
is hard to prove in practice.  It is not usual to cite tool chains in scientific literature, so citation counts are likely to
vastly under-represent the scientific use of Matplotlib.  However, a
canonical reference for Matplotlib~\cite{Hunter:2007} has over 12,750
citations, while a common reference of NumPy~\cite{walt2011numpy} has
over 6,800 citations (these counts illustrate the problem in
measuring usage via citations: Matplotlib depends on
NumPy, yet Matplotlib has almost twice as many citations).
AstroPy~\cite{robitaille2013astropy} has about 4,500 citations.

\subsection{Objectives}



% - need to re-engineer Matplotlib's data model
% - have on-going work to do design and prototypes
% - need significant SEW effort to implement across whole library
% - one nice thing is units, focus on documenting / planning / testing
% - another nice thing is resampling and out-of-core data access
% - we have to do this while keeping the patient writing papers


Matplotlib is a primarily community-driven project, but we have grown
to the point where we need supported developers with the time to
organize, plan, and make decisions.  Supported developers will allow
us to take on complex projects than cannot be implemented by part-time
volunteer effort alone while still ensuring that critical day-to-day
maintenance tasks required to keep the project healthy are done.
\textbf{We propose to split the effort on this grant equally between
  overhauling our internal data representation, and library
  maintenance}.


\subsubsection{Refactor Internal Data Model}
\label{sec:ridm}

Matplotlib is based on visualizing data stored in (Numpy) arrays,
which is a simple yet flexible data model that has been the
underpinning of data visualization for the last few decades.  However,
new data types are being developed and standardized that carry
structure and metadata beyond just the numerical values of the data.
Physical units are a key example of metadata that is being added, and
that a plotting package should handle gracefully.  Modern data
structures can also describe massive data sets and allow performing
operations on the data without loading the whole data set into memory
(i.e. dask, xarray); Matplotlib should leverage and be able to work
out of memory in concert with these packages.

While eliding many implementation details in the jargon of Matplotlib
an \texttt{Artist}

Eliding many of the implementation details, Matplotlib can be thought
of as having three primary layers~\cite{AOSA_mpl}: the user facing
methods; the \texttt{Artist} layer; and the backends.  The core of the
architecture is the \texttt{Artist}s which can be understood as
objects that produce something visible in the output.  Each individual
\texttt{Artist} is responsible for holding the user data and style
information for part of the final visualization, but the exact data
held varies between \texttt{Artist} classes.  For example,
\texttt{matplotlib.text.Text} is responsible for drawing text and
holds, among other things, the location of the text, the font, size,
color, and the actual string.  Internally Matplotlib represents a
\texttt{Figure} as a tree of \texttt{Artist}s.  The plotting methods
in Matplotlib create these objects and add them to the tree.  To
render the final output Matplotlib walks the \texttt{Artist} tree
depth-first and each each \texttt{Artist} is responsible for rendering
itself to the backend.  Thus, by changing the backend we can change the
output format from raster to vector without making any changes to the
\texttt{Artist} tree.


Currently, each plotting method and \texttt{Artist} independently
handles sanitizing and storing data.  Hence, each \texttt{Artist}
subclass holds its data in a different way and some common
functionality, such as handling data with attached units (e.g.,
degrees Celsius, dates), is repeated throughout the code base.  This
leads to inconsistencies across the library and makes it difficult for
users to write code that updates interactive explorations and
animations.  Another consequence is that Matplotlib also cannot
exploit ``Structured data''--combining multiple pieces of (possibly
heterogeneous) data with labels and metadata into single data
structure; instead, users must extract data elements and reassemble
them as arguments to Matplotlib plotting functions.

We have on-going theoretical and design work\footnote{Supported by
CZI} to re-architect Matplotlib to better separate the data
representation from the rest of the library.  We are developing a
consistent data access API such that each \texttt{Artist} will have a
single \texttt{DataSource} object responsible for providing access to
all of the data that the \texttt{Artist} needs.  This design will
allow us to over come many of the issues with the current design and
open the door to a variety of new functionality.  The current work is
expected to produce design documents and a proof-of-principal
implementation by the end of 2021.  Based on this preliminary work
\textbf{we propose refactoring all of Matplotlib to use the new data
  model}.  The proposed design is consistent with the rest of the
architecture; just as the \texttt{Artist}s are currently agnostic to
the backend used, the \texttt{Artist}s will be agnostic to exactly how
their underlying data is stored.

An immediate motivation for this this refactor is to improve
Matplotlib's handling of data with physical units attached.  Units are
fundamental to science and engineering, however most numerical
software is unit-naive.  It is the user's responsibility to keep track
of and correctly convert data to consistent units prior to any
computation.  Failing to do so leads to the most insidious of bugs:
everything ``works'' but silently gives incorrect results!  There are
several libraries which provide unit-aware data structures in Python
that can be used with Matplotlib for for unit-aware plotting.
\textbf{This capability is currently used to support spaceflight
  operations by Monte, JPL's mission design and navigation software
  system} and the initial development in Matplotlib was supported by
NASA.



% to what extent mpl currently supports units

The current support for physical units in Matplotib is based on
inspecting the data type passed by the user.  When the unit-full data
is passed by the user Matplotlib looks up a converter that sets
default axis label, limits, and functions for locating and formatting
the ticks.  Internally, Matplotlib uses the unit machinery to handle
datetime and string-categorical types and third-party libraries are
able to register their own converters.  Using this machinery users can
control what units the data is plotting in, which may be different
than the units it was passed in as, and specify the limits in physical
units.

% what is wrong
However, there are several problems with the current unit support in
Matplotlib.  It is under-documented making it difficult for users to
understand and use the capability and for developers to extend.
Coupled with a lack of full test coverage of using physical units,
over time the inconsistencies mentioned above have accumulated in the
code base.  These range from subtle inconsistencies between plotting
methods to unit-full data simply not working with some methods.
\textbf{To address this we propose to use unit-handling as a
  motivating feature while doing the \texttt{DataSource} refactoring}.
By implementing all of the unit logic in the \texttt{DataSource} we
will be able to share the code across all \texttt{Artist}s and unify
how we treat units across the library.


There is a broad recognition across the SPE of the importance of
supporting physical units as an intrinsic component of computation.
There is on going work in NumPy (NEP40-43), pandas, and xarray to add
support for physical units to the foundational data structures.  The
proposed work in Matplotlib will ensure that Matplotlib is ready to
plotting unit-full data to provide users with a complete solution to
working with unit-aware data.

In addition to fixing
the support of physical units, this refactor will lay the ground work for
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item smart down-sampling of plotted data based on view limits,
  \item native consumption of structured data,
  \item seamless updating of the underlying data, either interactively
    or via streams,
  \item and use of alternative data sources such as database queries
    or analytic functions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{General maintenance}

At the same time as rewiring Matplotlib's data model, there is work
that needs to be done to sustain Matplotlib as a vibrant project and
provide support for the hundred of thousands of users and hundreds of
downstream packages.  To maintain Matplotlib's health we need to:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item fix critical bugs and regressions promptly as they are reported;
\item triage Issues and PRs in terms of topic, difficulty, and
  urgency;
\item maintain backward compatibility and extensively document
  intentional changes;
\item entrain new contributors to sustain and diversify the community
  developer team;
\item maintain the continuous-integration infrastructure;
\item manage the release process;
\item and manage community discussions about proposed enhancements, features,
  and API changes.
\end{itemize}
These are tasks that are never ``done''; users find new ways to use
the library expose previously un-detected bugs, request, or propose new
features and the world continues to changes around us.   \textbf{Dedicated
full-time developers help ensure that things happen in a consistent and timely manner, and provide the crucial roadmaps that will steer the future of the library}.


%plot?

Historically, pull requests (PRs) and issues have been submitted
faster than they can be reviewed; Matplotlib has accumulated about 300
open PRs and 1300 open issues due to this imbalance. There are
critical bug reports and insightful feature requests among the issue
backlog, while among the PR backlog there are useful contributions or
bug fixes that would improve the libraries for direct users and
downstream packages.  The large backlog is discouraging for new and
occasional contributors and distracting for core developers.

In 2020 Matplotlib supported a Research Software Engineer (RSE)
working on Matplotlib, during which time we resolved 125-200 PRs and
75-125 issues a month.  However even at this rate on net we only
reduced the PR backlog by 70 open PRs and held even on the issue
backlog.  As part of reducing the backlog, we were able to fix several
long standing bugs.  We have demonstrated that supporting maintenance
work has a positive effect on the health of the project and
\textbf{the additional resources requested here will further reduce,
  but not eliminate, the maintenance backlog}.



\subsection{Relevance to Science Mission Directorate}

As mentioned above, it is hard to estimate the prevalence of open
source software due to it being freely distributed and not
systematically cited.  Matplotlib is in the top 100 most-downloaded
packages from PyPI~\cite{pypi_stats} and is packaged by every major
Linux and scientific Python distribution.  One path is static analysis
of publicly available code.  According to github over 299K
repositories and over 12k packages hosted on GitHub depend on
Matplotlib~\cite{gh_deps:2021} and a recent study of the almost 10M
Jupyter notebooks on github found that over 3M of them have a direct
Matplotlib import~\cite{datalore:2020}.


All of these measures show broad impact but cover many uses outside of
the SMD community.  Soliciting for examples of
Matplotlib in SMD research on social media yielded a (non-exhaustive)
list of examples of using Matplotlib
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item
  to study
  thunderstorms~\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JD025299,https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD030874},
  seasonal ocean winds~\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JD027516} and
  tropical storms~\cite{Lang_2020};
\item in the first science paper from the Parker Solar
  probe~\cite{Bale2019};
\item in the Martian science program in both
  orbiter~\cite{https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JE006188} and
  rover~\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/2016EA000219} contexts;
\item as part of ground operations from the Phoenix Lander;
\item with data from Kepler and K2 missions to study Trojan
  asteroids~\cite{Nixon_2019} and
  Titan~\cite{Ryan_2017,2019PASP..131h4505P};
\item on the New Horizons Kuiper belt extended
  mission~\cite{Porter_2018};
\item for visualization of scheduling, safety and constraint checks,
  and telemetry by the Swift science operations
  team~\cite{swift_ops,2020ApJ...900...35T};
\item as part of the HST and JWST~\cite{jwst_pipeline} data processing
  pipelines;
\item in Monte, JPL's mission design
  and navigation software system to support spaceflight operations;
\item in fundamental research on graphene~\cite{PhysRevLett.120.236802};
\item and for work on nuclear rockets~\cite{leu_cerment}.
\end{itemize}
This list shows the breadth of the use of Matplotlib across the SMD
divisions.  Small investments in Matplotlib will have returns across
the entire SMD portfolio.

Maintaining Matplotlib's health and engineering for its future will
have wide-ranging impacts for the scientific community, and NASA in
particular.  As pointed out above, Matplotlib is the plotting layer
for much of the python ecosystem.  It has been used in thousands of
academic papers, plotting for news and sporting media, technical
dash-boarding, and most modern data science applications.  As of
2018Q2 over a third of papers published to astro-ph on the Arxiv
contained a figure generated with
Matplotlib~\footnote{\url{https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/arxiv/index.html}}
which a clear tread upward.  Matplotlib has also been used in a number
of high-profile astronomy projects including the Nobel Prizing winning
observation of black hole merger by the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the recent observation of
Sagittarius A* by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).  Support for
Matplotlib will improve outcomes across disciplines, but in particular
Matplotlib is heavily used across SMD divisions, and by scientists in
academia who work with NASA in engineering, planetary science,
astrophysics, heliophysics, and earth observation.

This proposal is another step towards Matplotlib's sustainability, and
ability to move forward. Given the usage and the scale of the library
it is not sustainable to continue to maintain Matplotlib as a
volunteer-only effort.  A core team of full-time developers and
managers will better co-ordinate and nurture volunteer efforts, with
the goal of growing and sustaining a diverse community of volunteer
expert contributors.

Finally, by supporting Matplotlib's core developers, they
will better be able to plan its future and develop Matplotlib's roadmap.
This requires vision, co-ordination with the rest of the scientific
Python community, including downstream libraries, and getting out in
the community to get feedback.  It is very hard to provide that
leadership and vision while working a ``day job''.


\subsection{Risk Management}

There is minimal risk in the maintenance work.  There is large volume
of individually small tasks that need to be addressed: the issue and
PR backlogs.  Any dedicated effort devoted to clearing the backlog
will have a positive impact on the project.  We have demonstrated that
supporting developers for maintenance work is an effective and
efficient use of resources.


The data pipeline refactor carries more risk.  Given the large user
base it is imperative that changes are as backwards compatible as
possible.  While this large user base is on one hand a lever that
magnifies any improvements, it also makes changes more expensive.  We
cannot simply change our public interface to track the internal
refactoring, instead we must write also write code to translate the
old API to the new implementation.  This engineering work makes the
refactor more challenging and time consuming than starting from
scratch.  We rely on our extensive test suite to catch any unintentional
changes early in the development process.

% - need to be very careful about not breaking back-compatibility
There is also the risk than we are underestimating the amount of work
that will be required.  There is always a possibility that while
refactoring that the scope of work rapidly snowball due to unexpected
internal dependencies or edge cases that must be accounted for.
However, even in the case that we cannot fully deliver a new data
pipeline model, throughout the process we will be working towards
improving library internals and significantly improve our
documentation.

We anticipate that all of the work can be done incrementally and will
be merged to the default branch of Matplotlib throughout the
performance period.  Frequently merging incremental work reduces the
risk, and is consistent with our standard development process.  Work
done under this proposal will not be exempt from review, and many
small PRs are easier to review and merge than a single large PR.
Large PRs also quickly drift out of sync with the master branch, and
develop insurmountable rebase requirements.  The improvements, both to
the code and documentation, will be released to users as part of our
standard bi-yearly release cadence.


\subsection{Contributions of Principle Investigator and Key Personnel}

Dr.\ Thomas A.\ Caswell has the sole individual responsibility for
directing and supervising the execution of this work.  He has
extensive experience developing and maintaining Python libraries for
scientists.  He has been involved with Matplotlib from 2012 and had a
leadership role in the project from 2014.  He is also a core developer
of h5py and has contributed to many of the other core projects of the
SPE.  At Brookhaven National Laboratory he is the Lead architect and
developer of the Bluesky Suite, an ecosystem of co-developed libraries
and applications for data acquisition and management, which is being
adopted for beamline operations at synchrotrons in the US and across
the world.

\subsubsection{General Maintenance}

Throughout the project both Dr.\ Caswell and the RSE will work on Matplotlib general maintenance, community engagement.  Dr.\ Caswell will particularly focus on project roadmapping, and community governance.

% 4 part plan
%  1. document how units work now, document how it should work, id problems
%  2. work to adapt the theoretical and prototype datasource work to API stable
%  3. plan!
%  4. re-write every Artist sub-class

\subsubsection{Data Model Refactor}

\paragraph{Document Existing State of Data Pipeline} We will document, both at the conceptual and API level, how the unit
dispatch system currently works in theory and practice.  Given the
importance of backwards compatibility it is critical to understand
what we are refactoring before beginning.  This documentation will be
aimed at Matplotlib developers and focus on the low-level details.
Unfortunately, the original authors of the unit-handling code are no
longer active with the project so we may have to reverse engineer some
aspects of the code and motivation.  This documentation will be used
in further planning and as a reference for what is ``correct''
behavior when resolving inconsistencies.

% Internally we need to convert
% unit-full data to unit-naive values to pass to the next layer down.
% A
% common problem we have seen is issue with when and where we do that
% conversion.
% This documentation will clarify which layer of the API
% the conversions should be done in and how both the converted and
% unconverted data should be tracked and managed.
% For unit-aware
% plotting to be fully useful, it must work in every plotting method,
% thus we need clear documentation so that every Matplotlib developer is
% familiar with how unit works.
% Understanding and documenting how the
% unit-mechanism was intended to work and the current state of the
% library will be the foundation of the rest of the work.


\paragraph{Refactor Planning and Design} We are proposing to refactor a critical aspect and significant
fraction of the library we will develop a comprehensive plan.  As part
of developing this plan we will reach out to up-stream data-structure
libraries, such as pandas, numpy, xarray and the Consortium for Python
Data API Standards~\footnote{https://data-apis.org/}, to down stream
libraries, such as astropy, yt, and sunpy, and to users of the unit
machinery, such as \texttt{unyt}
(\url{https://unyt.readthedocs.io/}), \texttt{pint}
(\url{https://pint.readthedocs.io/}), \texttt{astropy.units}
(\url{https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/}), and the Monte
developers at JPL.  This will be a unique chance to change the
internal architecture of Matplotlib and we need to ensure that we
engage with all stack holders.

\paragraph{API Design} The core of the refactor will be a newly developed \texttt{DataSource}
interface.  This will provide a consistent interface for the
\texttt{Artists} to their data.  This interface, and the ability to
provide alternate implementation of data storage an access, is what
will allow the features discussed in section \ref{sec:ridm}.  The
theoretical and proof-of-concept work will be finished by the end of
2021.  Active work on both projects will overlap by 6 months and we
will actively engage to ensure that the theoretical work is
effectively translated.  We will fully specify the \texttt{DataSource}
interface and a write a reference implementation by the end of Y1Q3.
Concurrently we will developed a detailed schedule to refactor the
approximately 100 \texttt{Artist} classes in Matplotlib to use the new
data model.

\paragraph{Refactor Data Layer} As mentioned above, it is critical that we minimize the backward
incompatible API changes caused by the refactoring.  The variation
between \texttt{Artist}s is both what we are trying to address and the
biggest complicating factor.  Each class well need to be handled on a
case-by-case basis.  We anticipate that there will be significant
collateral work, such as writing additional tests to ensure that we do
not accidentally break current behavior, and implementing
back-compatibility shims, during the course of this work.  As we
preform this refactor we will also add tests that each \texttt{Artist}
and plotting method touched handles unit-full data correctly
\textbf{This work will impact a majority of the library} and is the
largest proposed change to the library in over a decade.

This whole process will be extensively documented, both inward facing,
so that future Matplotlib developers understand why decisions were
made, and outward facing so that users can make the most of the new
and improved functionality.


% - [ ] make sure it fits with new numpy dtype scheme (NEP 40-43)
% - [ ] make sure it works with pandas dtypes?

A secondary goal is to extend the unit machinery to improve the user
experience.  Currently much of the mechanism of unit-handling is
implicit and automatic based on type inference.  We propose to extend
the interface to allow optional direct control of the unit machinery
by users and third-party library developers.

\subsubsection{Work Process}

The Research Software Engineer (RSE), whom needs to be identified,
will devote 100\% FTE to this project.  This will be split evenly with
50\% FTE being spent on the refactoring and 50\% being spent on
general maintenance.  If the refactoring is completed faster than
expected, the RSE will devote 100\% of their effort to general
maintenance.


All work under this proposal will under go the standard review process
as any other contribution which has several advantages.  First, the
review process encourages many small PRs which reduces risk.  Given
our process, at least one maintainer not supported on this proposal will
need to sign off on any changes before they are merged.  This will
ensure that dissemination of understanding of the proposed work and
community buy-in to the proposed work.  Finally, by merging changes to
the default branch continuously through out the period of work the
incremental improvements will be released as part of our normal
release cadence.

The RSE will present the status of the work at two conferences yearly,
expected to be SciPy in July and one of PyData regional conferences in
the winter.






\subsubsection{Grant Management}

[TODO: does this need to go in next section?]
Dr.\ Caswell of BNL is the PI of the proposed development and is the
Matplotlib Lead Developer.  He is solely responsible for the quality
and direction of the proposed work and the proper use of all awarded
funds.  He is also responsible for all management, and budget issues
and is the final authority for this task.


\subsection{Matplotlib Project Management}
\subsubsection{Governance and Finances}

Matplotlib is a NumFOCUS Fiscally Sponsored Project and
the project governance is specified at
\url{https://github.com/matplotlib/governance/blob/master/governance.md}.

The project as a steering council, a Project Lead (PL), and several
Deputy Project Leads (DPL).  We are a community project and try to
make all decisions by consensus.  However, if consensus can not be
reached, the responsibility falls back to the DPLs and ultimately to
the PL.  The current PL is Dr. Caswell.

As Matplotlib has matured we have moved from a single person,
originally Dr. John Hunter, to a ``BDFL'' governance model.  The
leadership of the project passed to Dr. Micheal Droettboom in 2012.
In 2014 Dr. Caswell and Dr. Droettboom were co-leads and in 2016
Dr. Caswell took over as the sole project lead.  In 2020 we formally
adopted the current governance model.

\subsubsection{License}

Matplotlib is licensed under the Matplotlib License
(\url{https://matplotlib.org/users/license.html}) which is a
derivative of the PSF license
(\url{https://docs.python.org/3/license.html}) which is compatible
with the BSD license.


\subsubsection{Sustainability Metrics}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Continue Regular releases (mpl minor every 6mo, patch every 2mo
  or as needed).
\item Increase number of new regular contributors
\item Rate of PR / Issue throughput
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item caveats on how issues/PRs are very varied in time to resolve
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Collaboration with Related Projects}

As noted above, we will be working closely with both upstream and downstream projects on our refactor.  This work is timely as Numpy, Pandas, and xarray are all adding new data types with richer metadata and unit support to the python ecosystem.  Matplotlib must meet the challenge of supporting these new data types.    This will require constant communication with those projects.  Similarly, our changes will need to meet the needs of downstream domain-specific projects.  Many of these projects also have specialized data pipelines where they have prototypes of the changes we propose here.  Matplotlib will aggressively engage with these projects during the data pipeline refactor.

Much of the communication is through the standard communication
channels, such as project issue trackers, mailing lists or discussions
forums, and submitting PRs.  The strongest relationships, both
historical and current, are with projects where we have shared
developers.  For example Ryan May and Elliot sales de Andre are both
core contributors to Matplotlib and Cartopy and David Stansby is a
maintainer on both Matplotlib and \texttt{SunPy}.  Micheal Droettboom,
the previous Matplotlib Project lead, was a core developer on Astropy.
Additionally, through NumFOCUS and domain-specific conferences there
are regular in-person meetings.


% wording all NF projects are putting in, please avoid wordsmithing it.
As a NumFOCUS project, we recognize the importance of every project
that is part of our open source scientific computing community. Though
we would like for our work to be funded we are committed to supporting
and collaborating with other NumFOCUS projects that receive funding
regardless of our own outcome. We believe that this attitude is
crucial for the success of our community and the sustainability of
open source projects. It is our hope that this sentiment will be taken
into consideration when evaluating our proposal.


\subsubsection{Inclusive Community Development}

Matplotlib strives to be an inclusive and open project and have
adopted a Code of Conduct
\url{https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md}.
Anyone who is willing and able to contribute to the project should feel
welcome to do so.  It is important for everyone working on the project
to feel safe to make mistakes.

We have recently started two efforts to improve the development and
retention of new contributors: an ``incubator'' channel on gitter and
a Triage Team.

The hardest part of getting started to contributing to open source
projects is can be simply getting started.  The incubator is a
semi-closed chat room where new contributors can get support on any
aspect of contributing to Matplotlib.  This include the technical
aspects of the code they are working on, help with git/github, our
review process, or the social expectations and norms of the community.  The
goal is that by providing this support to first time contributors we will
retain more of them as regular contributors and then maintainers.

The issue tracker is important to communication in the project because
it serves as the centralized location for making feature requests,
reporting bugs, identifying major projects to work on, and discussing
priorities.  For this reason, it is important to curate the issue
list, adding labels to issues and closing issues that are resolved or
unresolvable. Triaging issues does not require any particular
expertise in the internals of Matplotlib but is extremely valuable to
the project.  To this end we have created a ``Triage Team'' in the
organization who have power to tag, milestone, and close issues.  In
addition to the direct benefit of improving the issue triage and
freeing the core-developers to spend more time reviewing PRs, this
role will bring more people into the developer community and may
provide a path way to becoming regular contributors and maintainers.

Ongoing work at NumFOCUS to develop metrics will help us evaluate the
efficacy of these efforts at diversifying our contributor base.

\subsubsection{Contribution Workflow}
%check that this is not a required title
%\subsection{Technical approach and methodology}


Matplotlib is an established community driven project in the
``federation'' model as defined by Nadia Eghbal~\cite{eghbal_2020}.
We have a core group regular maintainers who take responsibility for
reviewing and merging proposed changes to the library and  welcome Pull
Requests from anyone who is interesting in contributing.  We strive
for consensus and rely on the collective judgment of our maintainers
to maintain the quality and functionality of the library.

Matplotlib uses a variation on the ``git flow'' process~\cite{ghflow}
to manage proposing and reviewing contributions to the library and
documentation though on GitHub.  A contributor, a core maintainer, a
regular contributor, or a first time contributor, proposes a change by
opening a ``Pull Request'' from their fork of Matplotlib.  The
proposed changes are reviewed by maintainers who either request
changes, which starts a cycle of iteration with the contributor, or
approve.  In addition to human review we have an extensive test suite
that is automatically run via cloud services and the results are
reported to the PR.  Once consensus is reached and the test pass the
PR is merged and the changes will be released as part of the next
release.

Matplotlib maintains an extensive suite of automated tests that covers
a large fraction of our code base.  The full test suite, and a build
of the documentation, is run against several versions of Python on
OSX, Windows, and Linux hosts on every PR and merge to the default
branch via continuous integration.  For every new feature or bug fix
that gets merged we also add tests that codify the expected behavior.
This gives us the ability to make changes to the library with
confidence that we will not break existing behavior.

The threshold for merging a PR depends on the reviewer judgment of the
risk of the changes.  PRs that only change documentation, which cannot
introduce regressions or introduce new features, may be merged by the
first reviewer where as code changes need to be reviewed and approved
by at least two maintainers.  However in either case a maintainer may
wish to leave a positive review but not merge the PR to request
additional feed back from other maintainers.  If a maintainer objects
to a PR, the PR will not be merged until their concerns have been
addressed.  If consensus cannot, the final decision falls back to a
Deputy Project Lead or the Project Lead.

Matplotlib is cautious about making backwards-incompatible change that
intentionally break users existing code.  While in an ideal world,
future versions of the library would be 100\% backwards compatible
with previous versions, sometimes we do need to make incompatible
changes.  As part of the review process we check that any API changes
are well documented and justified.  When technically possible we
provide user-visible warnings the version before we actually implement
a breaking change.  This provides a window for users to either adapt
to the change or to communicate to us that they cannot adapt so we
can reconsider the change.  Given this high barrier to changing or
removing behavior we are careful to make sure that any new API we add
to the library is well thought out and complete because once we have
released a version of the library with that code it is hard to take it
back.  These considerations together are important enough that we have
a Deputy Project Lead responsible for API consistency.

This process works well for incremental contributions and bug fixes,
new features or bigger changes are typically discussed before
significant work is done.  In many cases if the feature does not need
to be in the core library we encourage contributors to create a new
stand-alone project.  This has several advantages including the giving
the author more control, allows them to iterate faster than our
relatively slow 6 month release schedule, and gives them greater
flexibility to change their APIs.


\subsubsection{Information Dissemination}

As a project Matplotlib maintains a range of communication channels
aimed at several, overlapping, audiences.  This includes a
the source, issue tracker and PRs on GitHub,
the published documentation (including historical and development versions),
weekly developer call,
mailing lists,
a discourse forum,
an active chat room on gitter,
in-person presentations at conferences and pydata events,
a blog, and several social media accounts.


The center of gravity of Matplotlib development takes place on GitHub
(\url{https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib}) where the canonical
repository for the source and documentation are hosted.  Around this
repository we use Issues and PRs to track bug reports, feature
requests, and to discuss proposed changes.  We also host our
governance documents on GitHub
(\url{https://github.com/matplotlib/governance}) and revise them via
Pull Request.

We publish extensive prose, example, and API documentation
(\url{https://matplotilb.org}) that is refreshed with each release.
In addition to the top-level docs, which always refer to the most
recent release, we also host historical
(\url{https://matplotilb.org/3.1.3} for the v3.1.3 documentation) and
development versions of the documentation
(\url{https://dev.matplotilb.org}).  In 2020 we had between 700k-1M
unique visitors a month to the documentation.


The weekly developer calls are typically attended by six to eight
people and are used for high-bandwidth discussions about both the
overall direction of the project and technical issues depending on the
day.  The agenda and minutes are publicly available
(\url{https://hackmd.io/team/matplotlib}) and the calls are open to
all.

Matplotlib has an active gitter
(\url{https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib}) chat room.  Gitter is
a real-time chat platform that we use for general coordination and
resolving minor technical discussions.  While the chat room's history
is technically persistent, we treat it as transient.  For more in
depth discussions or anything we want a record of, we move the
conversation to github, the mailing list, or discourse.

For user support and general discussion we maintain two mailing lists,
matplotlib-users
(\url{https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users}) for
user support and matplotlib-devel
(\url{https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-devel}) for
developer discussion and announcements, and a discourse
(\url{https://discourse.matplotlib.org}) instance.  While users have
to subscribe and register respectively to post, these forums are open
to all.  We also maintain a read-only mailing list for announcements
(\url{https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-announce}).

When we could travel, Matplotlib developers would frequently attend
in-person meetings including SciPy and PyData events.

We have a blog (\url{https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/}) that hosts
user-submitted content highlighting work they have done using
Matplotlib.  We have project accounts on several social media platform
including twitter and Instagram.

\section{Data Management Plan}
\setcounter{page}{1}

Matplotlib is a software library and does not produce any scientific
data as defined in E.1.2 that needs to be preserved.

Matplotlib is currently developed in the open on GitHub and is
released under a permissive license (the Matplotlib license which is a
derivative of the PSF license and compatible with BSD-3).  All work
done on Matplotlib as part of this grant will be done through the
current workflow, will be publicly available, and released under the
same license.  Matplotlib uses git for version control, thus every
developer has the full history on their computer which provides
significant redundancy.  Tagged releases of the software are published
to PyPI (in both source and binary forms).  In addition, Anaconada,
macports, homebrew, and all major Linux distributions independently
build, package, and host Matplotlib.  User facing documentation is built
and hosted at \url{https://matplotlib.org}.

%do we need something about shape files / map tiles?

Any new libraries created as part of the ROSES award will be developed
in the open on GitHub and will released under a BSD-3 license.

% do we need this?
Any incidental work on other software packages, either upstream or
downstream of Matplotlib, will have to follow the license and
development of process of those projects.

\section{Budget Justification}
\setcounter{page}{1}

Due to being an established community driven project most regular
contributors have established and distinct primary institutions.  For
this reason significant portions of the budget will need to be
subcontracted to the primary institutions of key individuals who are
uniquely qualified for this work.

Salary support is requested for PI Thomas A Caswell (0.25 FTE in years
1-3).  He will oversee the Matplotlib aspects of the proposed work and
co-supervise the RSE.

Salary support is requested for a Research Software Engineer (1 FTE in
years 1-3).  The RSE will be responsible for carrying out the unit
work on Matplotlib and general maintenance tasks on both Matplotlib
and Carotpy.

Support is requested for the RSE to attend the SciPy conference in
Austin, TX each year.  Cost estimates are based on the following: Meal
per diem from the GSA website, airfare from NYC to ATX from
\url{https://travel.google.com}, 2019 registration and conference hotel.

\begin{description}
\item[airfare] \$500
\item [lodging] \$770 (5 nights at \$154/night)
\item [Registration] \$700
\item [per diem] \$396 (\$61/day)
\item [misk ground transport] \$100
\item [total for one person] \$2,466
\end{description}

Support is requested for the RSE to attend a PyData conference
someplace in the USA each year.  Cost estimates are based on the
following: Meal and hotel per diem from the GSA website for NYC in
November (as a worst-case scenario), airfare from NYC to LAX from
\url{https://travel.google.com}, and guidance from NumFOCUS as to the
registration fee.


\begin{description}
\item [airfare] \$500
\item [lodging] \$858 (3 nights at \$286/night)
\item [Regisration] \$200
\item [per diem] \$342 (\$76/day)
\item [misk ground transport] \$100
\item [total for one person] \$1,800
\end{description}


Total requested for travel: \$12,798

[TODO add travel to visit collaborators / downstream users]

\newpage
\section{Facilities and Equipment}
\setcounter{page}{1}

Standard desktop workstations that Caswell has access to, either
through BNL or personal hardware, is sufficient for this work.

We request \$4,000 to purchase a computer, monitor, and accessories
for the RSE.


[TODO do we want to ask for any CI / hosting budget here?]
