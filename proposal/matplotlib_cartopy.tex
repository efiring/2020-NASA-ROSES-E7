%% Needed for fonts in xelatex to work
%%%
% NOTE: I actually use XeLaTeX, which allows me to get the fonts
% exactly the way that I want them. For proposals, this means
% I can use Times New Roman instead of the default Computer
% Modern. I actually like Computer Modern, but since Times New
% Roman is standard, there's no point in throwing off a reviewer
% with an unexpected font, particularly one with such a
% polarizing reaction in readers. New upset the reviewrers, I
% always say.
%
% What's the point of this bit of rambling? If you do not want to use
% XeLaTeX and would rather stick to good old LaTeX, then you
% need to comment out the next few lines of font packages and
% font commands.
%
% If you want to use XeLaTeX but want different fonts, then you
% just need to change the name in the argument for \setmainfont
% and \setsansfont. Make sure that the font you use is loaded on
% your machine and your TeX distribution knows how to find it.
% See Google if you need to learn more about this.

Matplotlib is a software library and does not produce any scientific
data as defined in E.1.2 that needs to be preserved.

Matplotlib is currently developed in the open on GitHub and
is released under a permissive license (the Matplotlib license which
is a derivative of the PSF license and compatible with BSD-3).  All work
done on Matplotlib as part of this grant will be done through the current
workflow, will be publicly available, and released under the same license.

Cartopy is currently developed in the open on GitHub and is released
under the LGPL.  All work done on Matplotlib as part of this grant
will be done through the current workflow, will be publicly available,

Any new libraries created as part of the ROSES award will be developed
in the open on GitHub and will released under a BSD-3 license.


% do we need this?
Any incidental work on other software packages, either upstream or
downstream of Matplotlib and Cartopy, will have to follow the license
and development of process of those projects, however precedence will
be given to OSS projects.
